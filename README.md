# MixtureJS

The toolkit combining React-style mixins, Backbone-style events, and minimal set of Underscore-style object manipulation functions.
Written in TypeScript, works with ES5, ES6, and TypeScript.

Just what you need when you're working in modern ES5/ES6 envorinment, packed in API which you already know.

## Features

- `Mixable`, React-style mixins implementation.
    - Fine-grained control over member merge rules.
    - Can mix both classes and plain objects.
    - Works with and without ES6 class decorators.
- `Object.extend` to simulate classes in ES5.
    - 100% backward compatible with Backbone `.extend()`.
    - Complete `Mixable` support.
    - Native properties declatations (`properties` specification).
- `Messenger`, synchronous events.
    - Can be used as mixin and as a base class.
    - 100% backward API compatibility with Backbone Events (passes Backbone 1.2.x unit test)
    - Much faster than Backbone events.
- `tools`
    - Object manipulation tools (`assign`, `defaults`, `mapObject`, etc).
    - Simple logging API with variable log-level and overridable functions. Defaults to the `console`.
